          On 16 September 2022, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman named Mahsa Amini
          (Persian: مهسا امینی), also known as Jina Amini or Zhina Amini
          (Persian: ژینا امینی; Kurdish: ژینا ئەمینی),[4] died in hospital in
          Tehran, Iran, under suspicious circumstances, due to police brutality
          according to witnesses. The Guidance Patrol, the morality police of
          Iran's Law Enforcement Command, arrested Amini for not wearing the
          hijab in accordance with government standards. Police said she had a
          heart attack at a station, collapsed, and fell into a coma.[11][12]
          Eyewitnesses, including women who were detained with Amini, said she
          was severely beaten. These assertions, in addition to leaked medical
          scans,[1] led independent observers to believe Amini had had a
          cerebral hemorrhage or stroke. Amini's death resulted in a series of
          large-scale protests across the country which garnered international
          attention, including a statement from the United Nations High
          Commissioner for Refugees, putting a focus on violence against women
          in the Islamic Republic of Iran.[14][15][16][17] Several leaders,
          organizations, and celebrities around the world condemned the incident
          and expressed solidarity with the protesters.[18] The United States
          Department of the Treasury and Canada imposed sanctions on the
          morality police and Iranian leaders in various security organizations.

            The couple's first stop was Riga, the capital of Latvia. "We had
            been there before and we loved the city; it was affordable, small
            and comfortable," says Nieto Carvajal. On previous visits, they'd
            also made connections at a co-working space called TechHub, which
            made settling in easier. Before long, the couple headed on to
            Berlin, and soon they were hooked on the thrill of exploring a new
            place, and what Nieto Carvajal calls the "freedom" of not being tied
            down.
